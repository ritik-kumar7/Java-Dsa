A constructor in Java is a special method used to initialize objects. It has the same name as the class and does not have a return type.

Properties of a constructor:

The constructor name must match the class name.
It has no return type (not even void).
It is called automatically when an object is created.
You can have multiple constructors in a class (constructor overloading).
If you donâ€™t define any constructor, Java provides a default no-argument constructor.
